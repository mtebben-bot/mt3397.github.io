### Academic Experience

I graduated from USC in May 2019 with dual degrees in International Relations and Neuroscience. I am currently a second-year MPH student at the Mailman School of Public Health in the department of Epidemiology. I am also getting my certificate in Public Health and Humanitarian Action.


### Professional Experience

I worked with the National Institutes of Health as a Downstream Production Intern in the Vaccine Production Program and Laboratory in Gaithersburg, Maryland. I assisted in the development of improved protocols for vaccine purification processes. I independently conducted experiments over the course of two summers to reduce waste and increase the efficiency of the processes necessary to properly purify vaccine candidate molecules.
