### Loading libraries

Here, I am loading my libraries and dataset.

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

data("rest_inspec")
```

### Cleaning data

Next, I want to clean my data.

```{r}
nyc_rest = 
  rest_inspec %>% 
  select(boro, critical_flag, cuisine_description, dba, zipcode, grade) %>% 
  filter(
    !is.na(grade)
  )
```

### Plot 1

Using my clean dataset, I want to make a graph
